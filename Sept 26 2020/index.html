    <h4>VISUAL CREATIVITY</h4>
    There's more visual freedom in parallax website design.Rather than<br>
     focusing on block style information architecture,you can create<br>
	 refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful<br>
	 photography,that act as a continum ultimately inspiring users to<br>
	 scroll further down the page.

     Do you want to tell a story with your product or service?<br>
	 long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative and<br>
	 encourages meaningful interaction from users.

<div class="live">
     Mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites.Its<br>
	 now less about clicking and more about scrolling,swiping and tapping.<br>
	 Long-scaling websites take away the barier of complex navigation<br>
     provding a responsive,user-friendly experience for mobile users.

<div class="live">
      Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor<br>
	  website browsers,as if forces businesses to convey their<br>
	  message and vision into one dyanamic web design page

<div class="heading fontch"><span>E</span>ASIER FOR USERS TO REALISE THEIR GOAL</div>
<div class="live">
     These days scrolling is so simple thats it's become an<br>
	 instinctive action,whereas clicking through to another page<br>
	 requires thought and motivation.A single page website<br>
	 allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker.<br>
	 than needing to sit through multiple pages.

<div class="heading fontch"><span>L</span>ONG SCROLL: THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF</div>
<h4 class="h4">YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVY</h4>
<div class="live">
     One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that<br>
	 they are not SEO friendly.Why? When you limit the number of <br>
	 pages on your website,Google has fewer pages to index and <br>
	 negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results<br>
	 page(SERP).Luckily there are ways around this.

<div class="heading fontch"><span>S</span>LOWER LOAD TIMES</div>
<div class="live">
     50% OF website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds.So the<br>
	 more high resolution imagery and animations and include,the longer it takes to<br>
	 load the page.When writing this article,we tested some popular parallax<br>
	 websites,and found that the ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to <br>
	 load on a mobile device,whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websited<br>
	 loaded within a few seconds.

<div class="heading fontch"><span>A</span>WKWARD NAVIGATION</div>
<div class="live">
     Instead of hitting the "back" button,users must scroll back<br>
	 up the page which can be frustating for users who want to<br>
	 refer back to a certain element.An easy way around this is<br>
	 to include top navigation and have each elemeny anchored<br>
	 to a category or section.
