About HTTP :

HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.It mainly uses GET and POST method.


I) Difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2 

 
HTTP 1.1 

* HTTP/1.1, the first standardized version of HTTP, was introduced in 1997.
* It supports connection reuse i.e. for every TCP connection there could be multiple requests and responses and pipelining where the client can request several resources from the server at once.
* It introduced the feature of persistent connection,pipeling,cache - control.
* Headers are sent on every request leading to a lot of duplicate data being sent uncompressed across the wire.
* Text based protocol that is in the readable form.
* Digest authentication used in HTTP1.1 is an improvement over HTTP1.0.


HTTP 2.0

* HTTP 2.0 was introduced in 2015.
* Uses multiplexing, where over a single TCP connection many responses will be provided to the client almost at the same time.
* It also provides a feature called server push that allows the server to send data that the client will need but has not yet requested.
* Header compression is included by default in HTTP/2 using HPACK.
* It is a binary protocol (HTTP requests are sent in the form of 0s and 1s). Needs to be converted back from binary in order to read it.
* Though security is still not mandatory, it is mostly encrypted.

                                       

II) Difference between GET and POST method.

GET 

* Requests data from a specified source.
* GET requests can be cached.
* GET requests remain in browser history.
* GET requests can be bookmarked.
* GET requests have length restrictions.
* GET requests should not be used while dealing with sensitive data(passwords).


POST 

* Submits data to a specified resource.
* POST requests cannot be cached.
* POST requests do not remain in browser history.
* POST requests cannot be bookmarked.
* POST requests have no restrictions on data length.
* POST requests are safer as searched data are not stored in browser history.
 
                                        

III) Differences between Browser JS(console) and NodeJs console.

Broswer Js

* Browser is the Front End where JavaScript is used.
* Here JavaScript is sandboxed in browser which acts as a strict environment with restrictions and can only access prompt here.
* The browser is interacting with the DOM here.
* In browser environment,you don't get the luxury to choose what browser your visitors will use.


Nodejs 

* Nodejs is the Back End where Javascript is used.
* JavaScript running on Nodejs can directly access the file system and more.
* Nodejs does not contain window or document objects.
* Nodejs can control the environment and even knows which version of Node the application will run on.
