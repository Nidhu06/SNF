I) Use typeof in all the datatypes and check the result

typeof(1)         - number
typeof(1.1)       - number
typeof("1.1")     - string
typeof(true)      - boolean
typeof(null)      - object
typeof(undefined) - undefined
typeof([])        - object
typeof({})        - object


II) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript 

Every web page resides inside a browser window which can be considered as an object.

A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in the window.

A Document object has various properties that refer to the other objects which allow access to and modification of document content.

The way a document content is assessed and modified is called the Document Object Model or DOM.

The Objects are organized in a hierarchical structure.

     -  The Window object is supported by all browsers and represents the browser's window. Eg window.innerWidth (inner width of Browser window)

     -  The Document object refers to HTML document and can be created using html <body> tag.

     -  The Form objects are enclosed in the <form> ...</form> tags.It contains form elements defined objects such as fields,buttons,radio buttons and checkboxes.
